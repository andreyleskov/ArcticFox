## Profiles
The main difference is the profile based user interface, so to say, the DNA-style, and the larger focus on customization than original Joyetech firmware.
Profile is the set of parameters of used atomizer, such as coil material, resistance, power and temperature values.
The user have 8 profiles which can be edited with NFE Toolbox, and which can be assigned to his favourite atomizers.

Profiles can be switched automatically, based on saved coil resistance, and in manual mode. All you need to use the automatic switch is to enable "Smart" mode, install atomizer and assign them to the desired profile.

When you re-install this atomizer later, assigned profile will be activated automatically.
If resistance of installed atomizer is not found in profiles, you'll be prompted to select new profile or re-assign existing.
When you switching manually to profile that have saved resistance mismatch, you'll be prompted to update or keep settings of selected profile.

## Main Menu

Hold Fire and Plus buttons for a 1 second to enter menu.

* **Wire** - coil material, temperature sensing or not (VW), can be set to standard or user-defined TFR;
* **Coil** - saved resistance;
* **TCR** - value can be edited when selected Joyetech TC algo with custom TCR;
* **T. Dom** - temperature-dominant regulation style;
* **Preheat** - power control, use preheat or power curve;
* **PI-Reg** - PI Regulator for TC mode, improves power and temperature stabilization:
     - PI-Reg On/Off - switch between stock Joyetech and PI regulation;
     - Range - 0..100% - temperature range when PI regulation becomes active. 0 means that regulator is always on and controls power distribution from start of puff, 20% for example - PI regulator turns on when temperature of coil reached 20% range from profile settings;
     - P - proportional constant, the larger it is, the sharper the power changed;
     - I - integral constant, the larger it is, the settled power distribution is smoother.

* **Dim** - time to dim display;
* **Wake <>** - waking mod by pressing regulatory buttons;
* **Charge** - show additional information on charging screen, battery voltage(s) and board temperature. Battery voltage order is shown on picture. Left voltage number is for battery on the left behind the screen, second is right behind the screen and third is in attachable case;
* **Logo** - show logo on main screen;
* **Clock** - show clock on screen:
     - Type - analog or digital;
     - On Main - show clock on main screen;
     - Saver - show clock in standby mode;
* **Contrast** - adjust brightness of display;
* **Skin** - change main screen style.

## Settings Menu

* **1 Watt** - increment/decrement power by 1,0 Watt;
* **Menu** - New - switch profiles using Selector, Old - switching via standard Edit Main action;
* **Smart** - automatic switching profiles settings:
     - On/Off;
     - resistance tolerance;
     - show Profile Menu after assigning new;
* **Clicks** - actions assigned on 2/3/4 Fire button clicks:
     - None;
     - Edit Main - Joyetech default 3-clicks action;
     - Profiles - Profiles Selector;
     - T. Dom - temperature-dominant on/off;
     - Clock - show/hide clock on main screen;
     - On/Off - switch mod on/off;
     - LSL - switch light sleep mode on/off;
     - Main Menu - enter Main Menu, the same as Fire + ;
     - Preheat - preheat settings for active profile;
     - Edit Profile - enter Profile Menu;
     - Smart On/Off
     - Show Info Screen
* **RTC** - realtime clock setup;
* **Expert** - settings for advanced users:

* **USB**
     - NoSlp - do not enter deep sleep mode while connected to USB;
     - Charge - device is charging batteries while connected to USB;
* **BVO** - batteries voltages offset;
* **BATT** - battery discharge profile;
* **SHUNT** - Ohm-meter correction;
* **ChkTCR** - check coil material TCR, switching this option to off can eliminate TCR Error on heavy coils;
* **RCOBC** - Reset Counters on Battery Change, clear vaping statistics;
* **X32** - RTC module uses secondary 32768 Hz oscillator, if present;
* **LSL** - Light Sleep Mode, for devices without secondary oscillator keep RTC accurate. It takes some more energy in standby mode, so user will be warned by ! sign right of battery indicator;
* **TEMP** - board temperature sensor, Ext - thermistor, Int - MCU
